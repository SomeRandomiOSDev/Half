**Half** is a lightweight framework containing a Swift implementation for a half-precision floating point type for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

Installation
--------

**Half** is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). 

To install via CocoaPods, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Half'
```

To install via Carthage, simply add the following line to your Cartfile:

```ruby
github "SomeRandomiOSDev/Half"
```

To install via the Swift Package Manager add the following line to your `Package.swift` file's `dependencies`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/SomeRandomiOSDev/Half.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

Usage
--------

First import **Half** at the top of your Swift file:

```swift
import Half
```

After importing, use the imported `Half` type excatly like you'd use Swift's builtin `Float`, `Double`, or `Float80` types. 

```swift
let value: Half = 7.891
let squareRoot = sqrt(value)

...
```

TODO
--------

* Add support for SIMD functions & types with half-precision
